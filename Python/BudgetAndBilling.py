# This program is intended to be used to calculate my weekly budget based on income that week and projected expenses that week.
print("Calculating Weekly/ Budget")

# This is usually weekly (net) income but can be another period like bi-weekly or monthly
print("Get Income for week/period")
income1 = float(input())

# At this point start inputting billing items. These are essentially billing items for the current week or period. 
# The question is at this point what direction this program will go? Will there be permanently assigned billing items or billing items adhoc defined each week. Can Flowgorithm define a true OO approach?
